# Apple-Webfont
This webfont enables use of the Apple Logo as U+F8FF (like on macOS/X). Icon from FontAwesome.
macOS/X users can type OPTION+SHIFT+K to create an apple logo character like this: ï£¿. However, on other operating systems this character looks different.
It is located in Private Use Area as character F8FF and now can be rendered properly on all OSs.

Font is in SVG, created at Fontello.com.

This repo is under GPLV3 and the font has its own license in LICENSE.txt.
